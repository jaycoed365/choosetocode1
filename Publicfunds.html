                            <p>A clear distinction between the terms "statistical arbitrage", 
                            "quantitative equity market-neutral", and "long/short equity" strategies.
                        Because all above is garbage at best and we are credit focused, with tongue in cheek
                        In our experience, investing successfully means taking the long-term view. Our investment 
                        professionals seek to identify securities that can do well over several years, by using 
                        fundamental analysis and paying close attention to valuations. We will dip as we carried 
                    a pair or while we build the position you will not be feared because the pair made of steel</p>
